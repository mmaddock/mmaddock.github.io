            <p class="par"><span class="fw">Leaves</span> are expressions of life branching <span class="fw">out, f</span>ormed by capturing light, thus enriching the whole tree.<br>
                Leaves become leaves in leaving, fading out the memory of past moments. <br>
                They therefore are a symbol of life’s constant effort of trapping and subsequent abandoning of the present,<br>
                 a perfect metaphor for the photograph.<br>
                A photograph becomes a photograph in the moment of the present leaving what the photograph tries to represent and fails to. <br>
                However, just like dried leaves, the photograph deteriorates and becomes a beautiful manifestation of itself on its own terms. </p>
