                    <p class="par">Leaves are expressions of life branching out, formed by capturing light, enriching the whole tree.<br><br>
                        When they leave, they fade out the memory of past moments. <br><br>
                        They are thus engaged in a constant effort of trapping and subsequent abandoning of the present.<br><br>
                        A photograph is born in the instant of the present leaving what the photograph fails to represent. <br><br>
                        However, just like dried leaves, the photograph deteriorates and becomes a beautiful manifestation of itself on its own terms. </p>
