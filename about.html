                    <p class="par">Leaves are expressions of life branching out, formed by capturing light, enriching the whole tree.<br><br>
                        Leaves become leaves in leaving, fading out the memory of past moments. <br><br>
                        They therefore are a symbol of life’s constant effort of trapping and subsequent abandoning of the present,<br>
                         a perfect metaphor for the photograph.<br><br>
                        A photograph becomes a photograph in the moment of the present leaving what the photograph tries to represent and fails to. <br><br>
                        However, just like dried leaves, the photograph deteriorates and becomes a beautiful manifestation of itself on its own terms. </p>
